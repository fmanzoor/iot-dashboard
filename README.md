# IoT Dashboard

This is a sample dashboard with minimal features and functionality. To get this up
and running, you just need to install [Web.py](http://webpy.org) and execute `python server.py`
from your terminal.

#TODO

Geez, there is a lot more to do here than I can even think but here is what comes
to my mind for now
* Add database and authentication ASAP
* Write tests for the authentication and security
* Write BASH scripts, at least for the features listed in server.py
* Integrate something like Bower to streamline things for future JS includes
* *A lot more...*
